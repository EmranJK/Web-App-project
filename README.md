# Web App Project

In this Project created a MovieList App which will give the user the ability to:

- Upload an image for the movielist.
- Comment.
- set up an account to have his/her unique movielists and movies with name, surname, email, password and profile image.
- Login to his account only with his valid email and password.


The app also has the ability to:

- Show the number of movielists and movies currently in the users account.
